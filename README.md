# Search based Recommendation Engine
An advanced search query based Recommendation System built using BERT based sentence_transformer model to recommendations for user input query.
We implemented semantic search, question answering, summarization and document ranking and correcting spelling error in the search query.

----

## Objectives
1. Recommend keywords that are more relevant to user’s search query by **improving accuracy relevence and optimising** the time taken.
2. Improving the **transactional impact by comparative visualization** of the dataset scraped and the keywords/analytics provided. Then combining the relevant keys for a better output.
3. Inserting extra features like **input auto-correction, similar searches** etc.

## Approach



1. Crawling the given site and scraping the data through Scrapy.

       Scraped Data : (2652,4)

2. Pre-processing the scraped data along with keywords provided and then calculating frequency weightage i.e. finding most searched.

4. **Implementing SBert model leading to :**




     a) Semantic Search (eg. insurance -> vehicle).

     b) Paraphrase Mining (i.e. Text with identical/similar meaning).

     c) Writing Search function -> Analyzing Query Vector ->Fetch into top k_ids.
